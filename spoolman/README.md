# Home Assistant add-on: Spoolman 🧵

Spoolman is a self-hosted web service designed to help you efficiently manage your 3D printer filament spools and monitor their usage. It acts as a centralized database that seamlessly integrates with popular 3D printing software like [OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org/) and [Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org/)/[Moonraker](https://moonraker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). When connected, it automatically updates spool weights as printing progresses, giving you real-time insights into filament usage.
