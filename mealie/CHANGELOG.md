## ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùóImportant Notice for PWA (Mobile) Users
**TL;DR If you use the PWA (most/all mobile users), after upgrading, uninstall your PWA and install the new one**

The PWA has been overhauled to meet more modern standards. The old PWA configuration was constrained heavily by the old Nuxt 2 framework, and had several odd quirks and simply didn't work in a lot of instances. The new PWA implementation works much better and should be compatible with all devices which support PWAs (including both iPhone and Android devices).

A consequence of this is that the way the app is identified internally has changed, so existing PWA installs won't recognize that there has been an update to the application. In order to continue using the PWA, once you update Mealie, _remove/uninstall_ your old PWA and re-install it.

## üéâ Highlights

- New Settings Layout. No more clicking on "settings" when you're looking for the data management page and remembering that it's, 
- Major performance improvements to the recipe overview page, making it several times more snappy.
- Lots of quality of life improvements, including many bugfixes.
- Upgrades to the PWA for mobile devices (see more above).
