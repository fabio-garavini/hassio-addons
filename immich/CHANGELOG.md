# v2.0.0 - Stable Release

Welcome to the release `v2.0.0` of Immich. This release marks the first stable version of Immich. You can read our announcement blog post [here](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/discussions/22546) to learn what stable means for Immich, what you can expect from a stable version, along with our future plans. Of course, it wouldn't be complete without a few surprises.

To update to this version, no special steps are required. Compose pull and compose up, and you are now on `v2.0.0`. Additionally, there are a few noteworthy items that we have been working on in preparation for the stable release:

* New homepage
* New API documentation
* New community metrics

## New homepage

The https://immich.app/ website has been recently updated. It‚Äôs been rewritten with our very own UI component library, and includes a [blog](https://immich.app/blog) with a few initial posts, including one about [the new mobile sync implementation](https://immich.app/blog/sync-v2). Existing documentation has been moved to https://docs.immich.app/.

## Better API documentation

We‚Äôre also happy to announce a new version of our API documentation, which is now live at https://api.immich.app/. The new docs include more information about authentication, authorization & permissions, a command palette for quick navigation (press `/` or `ctrl+k`), and a built-in method to view live results.
