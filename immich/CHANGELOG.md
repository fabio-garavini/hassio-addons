### Material 3 switch/toggle (web)

The web project has an updated switch/toggle, thanks to @SevereCloud (<https://github.com/immich-app/ui/pull/267>) for that.

### Bring back configurable backup settings (Android)

Just like the previous timeline implementation, the new version now has similar settings for 

* Backup only while charging
* Upload only after a minimum amount of elapsed time


### Concurrent hashing & hashing progress (mobile)

Improvements have been made to the client-side hashing implementation, which now enables hashing to happen *concurrently*. This significantly increases throughput, and now the speed is mostly limited by how fast files can be read from internal storage. The hashing process has also been updated to only hash assets from the albums selected for backups, which reduces the number of downloads for iCloud users.

### Download progress (mobile)

The mobile app now has a built-in download progress indicator, which makes it easy to see the progress of files being downloaded onto the device.

### Notable fix: Web modals

Previous to this release, the web application would often ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù or become unusable after using a modal (creating a shared link, creating an api key, confirming the deletion of assets, etc.). This issue has been fixed.


### Notable fix: Mobile ‚Äúfreezes‚Äù

This release fixes an issue that the mobile application could occasionally ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù, with the thumbnails would stop loading, and certain pages would become unusable until the application was forced closed. This has proved much more challenging to solve. We determined that the cause was due to concurrent access to SQLite from background/foreground processes, which could have put the app into this state. We have taken measures to address these situations and believe the application should be much more *stable*. If you are still running into these types of issues, please let us know!


### Notable fix: Copy image on Safari

The ‚Äúcopy image to clipboard‚Äù functionality has long worked on non-Safari browsers, but in this release, we were finally able to identify and implement a fix. Copying an image to the clipboard should now also work on Safari.
