# v2.1.0

Welcome to release `v2.1.0` of Immich!

It‚Äôs been about 2 weeks since our [stable release](https://immich.app/blog/stable-release) :tada: and the celebratory [Retro DVD](https://immich.store/products/immich-retro) :dvd:, which many of you are starting to receive. For those outside the US still waiting for theirs, we're currently awaiting a new batch of DVDs. Hopefully, those start shipping early next week at the latest. 

We‚Äôd like to take a moment to thank everyone for the support, kind words, and  otherwise positive feedback. It‚Äôs been great to hear, and it means more to us than you know :hearts:.

## Highlights

This release contains mostly bug fixes, with a few minor enhancements. Here are some of the highlights:

* Improved slideshow shuffle order (web)
* Edit seconds and milliseconds (web)
* Upload to stack (web)
* Local album event notifications (web)
* Notable fix: mobile search page scrolls back to the top 

As always, this release also contains the latest [translations](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/immich/immich/).

### Improved slideshow shuffle order (web)

This release improves on the algorithm used to implement the  `Shuffle` order for the slideshow feature on the web. You should now see a better distribution of photos (fewer repeats).

### Edit seconds and milliseconds (web)

The change date modal on the web now supports the option to specify seconds and milliseconds.

### Upload to stack (web)

For stacks, a new menu option has been added: `Add upload to stack`. This action will open a file picker, allowing you to upload directly to the stack.

### Local album event notifications (web)

This release adds a new in-app notification type: `Shared Album Invitation` and `Shared Album Update`. When you are invited to a shared album, and when a new asset is added to it, all users will receive a notification about the update. You can click on the notification to go directly to the mentioned album.

The foundation for in-app (web) notifications was introduced in #17701, and we‚Äôre still working on expanding it to include more event types, with the hope of eventually incorporating it into the mobile app as a push notification.

### Notable fix: mobile search page scrolls back to the top

The search page on mobile uses ‚Äúinfinite scroll‚Äù, which means new chunks of assets are automatically loaded in as you scroll down the page. However, prior to this release, the scroll position would reset to the top whenever new chunks were added, resulting in a frustrating user experience. This has been fixed, and the scroll position no longer resets.
