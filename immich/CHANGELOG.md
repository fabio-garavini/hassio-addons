# v1.142.0

## Highlights

Welcome to release `v1.142.0` of Immich. Starting with this version, the beta timeline is now the default version for the app. When you first open the app after updating, it will check and run the on-device migration steps for those that are on the old timeline, after that you can close and relaunch the app to start with a better app experience. We want to express our sincere gratitude again for the users who have been using the new version to help us polish it, and for those who work closely with us to tackle weird bugs. As always, this version comes with many bug fixes for the server, web and the mobile app. Let‚Äôs dive into some of the highlights below.

* Resume all paused jobs
* Geolocation utility improvements
* Read-only mode toggle on the mobile app has changed to a long-press behavior instead of a double-tap
* Notable fix: Raspberry Pi 4 crashes when generating thumbnails
  * If you were affected by this bug and set the environmental variable `VIPS_NOVECTOR=1`, you should remove this variable when upgrading to this Immich release or above

### Resume all paused jobs

The job administration page now comes with a resume all button. This is especially helpful for users who are importing their libraries to Immich via [immich-go](https://github.com/simulot/immich-go), which pauses all jobs during upload, including background jobs not visible in the UI. If the process fails mid-way, the jobs stay paused until the admin either recreates the Redis container or manually resumes them. If you‚Äôve been having problems with the trash not clearing or memories not generating, make sure to check this button.

### Geolocation utility improvements

The geolocation utility has been converted to a timeline view, so you can easily scroll through your entire library while investigating

You can now browse the timeline, and at the same time, fill in the missing coordinates for your assets. Thanks @Johannbr for your continued work on this.
