# v1.142.1

_Hey guys, Alex here._ 

_Sorry about the rocky release of version `v1.142.0`. Instead of giving you guys a better experience with the timeline, a mistake in the migration flow code that I wrote put the app into an erroneous state that makes it seem like the new timeline isn't working at all, and the only way to fix that was to log out and log back in manually. For that, I personally apologize for the inconvenience and the frustration that I caused over the weekend. This patch release addresses those issues and some other bugs that were reported over the weekend. If you have problems, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or the team on Discord or GitHub_

In release `v1.142.0`, during the migration from the old timeline to the new one on the mobile app, the sync checkpoint isn't getting reset, leading to the data not being pulled from the server. During the development of the new timeline, while on the old timeline, the sync endpoint might have been triggered at some points. The missing sync information creates a perception of data loss and mismatched sync information for the mobile app. This release reset the sync checkpoints so that they can be pulled down correctly for everyone.

> [!TIP]
> For the new timeline to pull the correct information, please consider updating your server to the latest version. We have seen reports that the timeline isn't working because it was connecting to an older version of the server

This patch release also addresses the reliability of background sync on Android. We suggest that you don't swipe away to dismiss the app, but keep it in the background; this will prevent the background worker from being terminated by the OS. Further optimization of the background worker's operation when the app is dismissed will be implemented in the next few days, pending additional testing.
