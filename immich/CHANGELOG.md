# v1.144.1

_`v1.144.0` has been made a sacrificial object to the Release God_

Welcome to the release `v1.144.1` of Immich. This release marks the end of summer, with many bugs being squashed and the continuous improvement of the upload process on the new timeline. It also comes with enhancements to storage management for iCloud users when uploading a large library. The mobile app now also displays an indicator for LivePhoto or MotionPhoto, making them easier to recognize.
