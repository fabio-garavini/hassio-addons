# v1.141.1
## Highlight
Welcome to the release `v1.141.1` of Immich, as hot as this summer gets, the beta timeline is ready to be taken out of the kitchen, now with more features and bug fixes. Let‚Äôs dive right in while it‚Äôs still hot


* \[beta\] Auto-add uploaded assets to albums
* View similar photos
* DigitalOcean 1-click deployment
* Notable fix - thumbnail generation for 200MP HEIC images


### \[beta\] Auto-add uploaded assets to albums.

This feature has made its way back to the beta timeline. You can enable this feature on the `Backup Options` page. The current selected albums for backup will be linked with the album of the same name on the server, or a new album will be created if those albums don‚Äôt exist. Assets uploaded will be placed in the respective linked album.

### View similar photos

On the web, you can now look for similar photos or videos when viewing an asset by clicking on the `context menu > Find similar photos`. Powered by CLIP search to quickly identify photos with similar scenery and context

### Digital Ocean 1-Click Deployment

To help users who are interested in trying out the application without setting it up on their infrastructure, or who do not have the infrastructure available yet. We now have the option to deploy Immich directly on DigitalOcean.

The default configuration is the smallest pod size that can run Immich comfortably. The new instance is set up with a default reverse proxy that handles TLS. For more information, you can read [here](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/immich).

You can give it a try by clicking the button below
