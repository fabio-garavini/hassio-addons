# Home Assistant add-on: Spoolman Sync 🧵

## Install

Just click **Install** and **Open WebUI**

## Setup

Opening the app for the first time you need to set 3 things:

### **`Home Assistant URL`**

**Must be** the url you use to reach HA from your computer

### **`Spoolman URL`**

The url which `Spoolman Sync` uses to connect to `Spoolman` which if you are using Home Assistant OS should be `http://<spoolman hostname>:8000`

which by default should be:
```
http://3b88f413-spoolman:8000
```

### **`Spoolman Sync URL`**

In the **Automation** tab set the Spoolman Sync URL to `http://<spoolman sync hostname>:3000`

which by default should be:
```
http://3b88f413-spoolman-sync:3000
```
