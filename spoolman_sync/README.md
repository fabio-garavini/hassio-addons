# Home Assistant add-on: Spoolman Sync 🧵

SpoolmanSync automatically tracks which filament spools are loaded in your Bambu Lab printer's AMS units and syncs this information with [Spoolman](https://github.com/Donkie/Spoolman) for accurate filament inventory management. Works with **all filament brands** - not just Bambu Lab spools.
