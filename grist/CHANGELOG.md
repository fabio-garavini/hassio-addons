## Hotfix

grist-core 1.7.10 is a hotfix release that fixes a regression from 1.7.9 where the Grist Labs custom widget repository stopped being included as the default repository by mistake. As a result, Grist Labs and community custom widgets are no longer shown when adding a new custom widget, and any previously added Grist Labs or community custom widgets will fail to load.
